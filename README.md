# Mini-Projects

## Purpose
To better centralize common mini-projects that developers tend to create to solidify their understanding of the basics. 

## Goals
Goal number one would be to have a collection of mini-projects documented and available via a SPA. Goal number two would be to expose the repo to new developers looking to understand the process under the hood.
